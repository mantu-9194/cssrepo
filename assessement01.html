    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li> <br>       
        <li>CSS describes hoe HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li> <br>       
        <li><span1>CSS is not neccesary</span1> <span2>CSS saves a lot of work. </span2> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li><br>        
        <li><span3>Stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span3></li>        

    </ol>
    <br>

    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by  using  the style  attribute inside  HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by  using a  style element in the  head section</li>
        <li>External - by  using a  link  element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in the external CSS files.However,<span4>in this 
            tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span4> because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier
            for you to try it yourself.    
        </li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS applies a style to multiple elemets.ID,on the other hand,
        applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>In CSS,selectors are used to target  a specific element or range of elements on a Web Page.once an element has been
        targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to 
        target elements to which a style should be applied.
